**Annadata**

Food Authenticity & Price Intelligence Engine

Annadata detects economically impossible food pricing using official recipes and real-time ingredient costs.

If a dish costs less than its ingredients, adulteration becomes likely. We identify that risk before it reaches the consumer.

The Problem

Rising food inflation pushes vendors into a Survival vs Safety dilemma.

When ingredient prices increase:
	•	Quality is reduced
	•	Synthetic fillers replace real ingredients
	•	Unsafe shortcuts are hidden behind low prices

Consumers cannot tell whether a cheap dish is:
	•	Genuine value
	•	Or economically impossible without adulteration

Our Solution

Annadata calculates the Honest Cost of a dish in real time.

Step 1: Official Recipe

We fetch standardized ingredient lists and quantities.

Step 2: Live Market Prices

We pull current ingredient prices from verified sources.

Step 3: Honest Cost Calculation

We compute the minimum feasible cost to prepare the dish properly.

Step 4: Risk Detection

We compare vendor price vs Honest Cost and generate a:
	•	Safe
	•	Medium Risk
	•	High Risk

Step 5: Safe Alternatives

If risk is high, we suggest natural, safe substitutes based on flavor and molecular similarity.
